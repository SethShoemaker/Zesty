    Zesty is a CRUD application made in PHP Laravel for people to share cooking recipes. To post a recipe, users are required to create an account by entering a name, username and email. When posting a recipe users enter information about their recipe such as the title, a description, number of servings, ingredients, and the instructions. People looking for recipes can browse the front page, where the latest recipes are listed, or search Zesty for recipes that contain a certain word or phrase in their title, description or ingredients.
