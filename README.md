<h1>Web app is live at <a href="https://zesty.cooking" style="color:#1e8b1e;">zesty.cooking</a></h1>
<p>Zesty is a CRUD application made in PHP Laravel for people to share cooking recipes. My main purpose for building this project was to expose myself to the full-stack, and to challenge myself to learn new things. Originally this was to be built from scratch using a custom procedural design pattern, but after creating a very messy code-base I decided to use Laravel. I am satisfied with the new version built on Laravel, but my hope is to continue learning best practices for PHP and coding in general.To assist me in Authentication I used SendGrid to send welcome emails whenever someone first signs up for Zesty, and to send emails when someone wants to Reset their password</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>The main purpose of Zesty is for people to share cooking recipes with others, so my application allows for people to register or login, post a recipe by filling out a form (which includes image storage) and have others find their recipe either from the front page or the search page.</p>
